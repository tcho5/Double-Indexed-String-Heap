# Double-Indexed-String-Heap
Implemented a container of strings, which will be “indexed” in two ways, namely alphabetically, and by string length. We will call this a Doubly Indexed String Heap (DISH). We implement a Dish C++ class that contains a vector or a dynamically allocated array of strings that support many operations including, insert, find, capitalize, and more. Allows user to get the shortest string or first alphabetically ordered string in O(1) times.
